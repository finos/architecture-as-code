# CALM Schema v1.2 Release Notes

CALM v1.2 builds on v1.1 to introduce architecture timelines and decorators.

## Core Schema Concepts

Unchanged.

## Decorator Schema Concepts

Decorators attach supplementary information to nodes, relationships, and other architecture elements **without modifying** the core architecture definition. They enable cross-cutting concerns — such as deployment tracking, security context, business metadata, and operational information — to be managed separately from the architecture itself.

## Timeline Schema Concepts

**Moments** - Time-based architecture snapshots, enabling views of
architecture changes over time.

## Question and Feedback

For questions or feedback, please engage with the CALM community through the
appropriate channels.
