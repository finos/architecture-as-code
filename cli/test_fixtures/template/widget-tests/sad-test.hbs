# Conference Registration System - Solution Architecture

{{block-architecture}}

## 🎯 System Goals & Objectives

The Conference Registration System is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing conference attendee registrations. This system enables seamless user registration while maintaining data integrity and supporting high-volume traffic during peak registration periods.

### Primary Goals
- **User Experience**: Provide an intuitive, responsive web interface for conference registration
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent registrations during peak periods
- **Security**: Protect user data with industry-standard security practices
- **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime during critical registration windows
- **Compliance**: Meet data protection requirements for handling personal information

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern deployed on Kubernetes, providing scalability, fault tolerance, and easy maintenance. The architecture separates concerns between presentation, business logic, and data persistence layers.

### Data Flow Patterns

The system implements a layered communication pattern:
1. **External Layer**: HTTPS connections from users through the web interface
2. **Service Layer**: mTLS-secured internal service communication
3. **Data Layer**: Encrypted database connections with connection pooling
