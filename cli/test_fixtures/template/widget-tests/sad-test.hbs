# Conference Registration System - Solution Architecture

## 🎯 System Goals & Objectives

The Conference Registration System is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing conference attendee registrations. This system enables seamless user registration while maintaining data integrity and supporting high-volume traffic during peak registration periods.

### Primary Goals
- **User Experience**: Provide an intuitive, responsive web interface for conference registration
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent registrations during peak periods
- **Security**: Protect user data with industry-standard security practices
- **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime during critical registration windows
- **Compliance**: Meet data protection requirements for handling personal information

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern deployed on Kubernetes, providing scalability, fault tolerance, and easy maintenance. The architecture separates concerns between presentation, business logic, and data persistence layers.

### Component Functions

- **Conference Website**: React-based single-page application providing user registration forms, event information, and real-time availability updates
- **Load Balancer**: High-availability NGINX load balancer distributing traffic across service instances and providing SSL termination
- **Attendees Service**: Core business logic service handling registration validation, duplicate detection, and attendee management workflows
- **Attendees Store**: PostgreSQL database with optimized schemas for attendee data, supporting ACID transactions and data consistency
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Container orchestration platform providing auto-scaling, health monitoring, and zero-downtime deployments

### Data Flow Patterns

The system implements a layered communication pattern:
1. **External Layer**: HTTPS connections from users through the web interface
2. **Service Layer**: mTLS-secured internal service communication
3. **Data Layer**: Encrypted database connections with connection pooling
