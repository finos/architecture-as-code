# Welcome to Advent of CALM

A 24-day progressive learning challenge for the Common Architecture Language Model (CALM).

## What is Advent of CALM?

**Advent of CALM** is a structured learning journey that takes you from zero CALM knowledge to being able to model production architectures and contribute to the community in 24 days.

Inspired by "Advent of Code", this challenge provides daily hands-on tasks that progressively build your skills in architecture as code.

## How It Works

Each day from December 1st through December 24th, a new challenge unlocks. Each challenge is designed to build on the previous days, teaching you:

- **Week 1 (Days 1-7)**: Foundation & First Steps — Learn CALM basics and create your first complete architecture
- **Week 2 (Days 8-14)**: Controls, Flows & Documentation — Master governance, business flows, and use AI to analyze and document architectures
- **Week 3 (Days 15-20)**: Operations & Governance — Use CALM for operational support, then create patterns and standards for enterprise governance
- **Week 4 (Days 21-24)**: Platform Team Challenge — Apply everything you've learned in a multi-day project simulating real enterprise workflows
