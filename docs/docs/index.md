# Welcome to CALM

The Common Architecture Language Model (CALM) is an open-source specification developed by the Architecture as Code (AasC) community under FINOS. CALM enables software architects to define, validate, and visualize system architectures in a standardized, machine-readable format, bridging the gap between architectural intent and implementation.

CALM aims to move architecture beyond static diagrams by providing a common language that both humans and machines can understand, ensuring that architectural decisions are consistently applied and easily auditable.

## Why CALM?

In modern software development, architecture is often disconnected from the actual implementation, leading to inconsistencies, manual errors, and inefficiencies. CALM addresses these issues by:

- **Standardizing Architecture**: Use CALM's JSON Meta Schema to define your architecture, ensuring consistency across teams and projects.
- **Enabling Automation**: Automate architectural validation, compliance checks, and visualizations directly within your development pipeline.
- **Driving Productivity**: Use pre-approved patterns and reusable components to accelerate your architectural design process.
- **Ensuring Control and Compliance**: Align architectural designs with organizational standards and policies, making it easier to measure and enforce compliance.

> **Quick Start**  
> To get started with CALM, [install the CLI](working-with-calm/installation) and try your first commands to visualize and validate architectures.

## Key Benefits

- **Machine-Readable Architecture**: Define your architecture in a format that tools can interpret and validate, reducing manual errors.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your architecture as you would with code, facilitating better collaboration and change management.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on architectural compliance and potential issues during the development process.
