# Key Features of CALM

CALM is designed to revolutionize how we define, validate, and visualize software architectures. Below are some of the core features that make CALM a powerful tool for modern architects.

## 1. Standardized Definitions

At the heart of CALM is its JSON Meta Schema, which provides a standardized format for describing system architectures. By using CALM, architects can create consistent, machine-readable definitions of their designs, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear and uniform understanding of the system.

- **JSON-Based**: Leveraging JSON for architecture allows for easy integration with other tools and seamless version control.
- **Extensible Schema**: CALM’s schema can be extended and customized, allowing organizations to tailor it to their specific needs while maintaining core compatibility.

## 2. Validation and Compliance

One of the most powerful aspects of CALM is its ability to validate architectures against predefined patterns. This ensures that designs adhere to best practices and organizational standards.

- **Pattern-Based Validation**: Use CALM’s CLI to validate architectures against approved patterns, catching errors early in the design phase.
- **Automated Compliance Checks**: Integrate CALM validation into your CI/CD pipeline to enforce compliance automatically, reducing the burden of manual reviews.

## 3. Visualization

Understanding complex architectures can be challenging, especially when dealing with large systems. CALM provides visualization tools that generate intuitive, easy-to-understand diagrams directly from your architectural definitions.

- **Instant Diagrams**: Use the `visualize` command in CALM CLI to produce SVG files representing your architecture, facilitating discussions and reviews.
- **Dynamic Views**: Switch between different views of the same architecture, highlighting specific relationships or components as needed.

## 4. Patterns and Reuse

CALM supports the creation and reuse of architectural patterns, allowing you to encapsulate common designs and quickly generate them for specific use cases.

- **Reusable Components**: Define patterns for common architectural structures, such as microservices, API gateways, or data pipelines.
- **Pre-Approved Designs**: Use pre-approved patterns to speed up development, reduce review times, and ensure consistency across projects.

## 5. Integration with Existing Tools

CALM is designed to work with your existing toolchain, making it easy to adopt without disrupting your current workflows.

- **Translators**: Convert CALM schemas into other formats like C4 models or Kubernetes manifests, allowing you to maintain compatibility with popular architecture frameworks.
- **Custom Validation**: Extend CALM’s validation capabilities with bespoke rules to meet your specific requirements.
