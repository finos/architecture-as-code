# Modeling Guides

These guides help you model different aspects of your architecture beyond basic nodes and relationships.

## Available Guides

- [**Define Controls**](controls) - Add non-functional requirements like security, performance, and compliance
- [**Model Business Flows**](flows) - Document how processes and data flow through your system
- [**Document Decisions with ADRs**](adrs) - Record architecture decisions and their rationale

## Prerequisites

Before using these guides, you should be comfortable with:
- Creating CALM nodes and relationships
- Basic JSON and the CALM schema structure
- Using the CALM CLI or VSCode extension

If you need to learn these basics, start with the [Beginner Tutorials](../../tutorials/beginner/).
