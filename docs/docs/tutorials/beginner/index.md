# 🟢 Beginner Tutorials

**No prior CALM knowledge required**

Welcome to the beginner tutorials! These seven tutorials will teach you the core building blocks of CALM architectures. By the end of this section, you'll be able to create complete architecture documents from scratch.

## What You'll Learn

| Tutorial | What You'll Master |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Setup & CLI](./01-setup) | Install tools and initialize your workspace |
| [First Node](./02-first-node) | Create your first architecture component |
| [Relationships](./03-relationships) | Connect nodes with different relationship types |
| [VSCode Extension](./04-vscode-extension) | Visualize and navigate your architecture |
| [Interfaces](./05-interfaces) | Define how nodes communicate |
| [Metadata](./06-metadata) | Document ownership, versioning, and context |
| [Complete Architecture](./07-complete-architecture) | Build a realistic e-commerce system |

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Git** installed
- **Node.js** (20+) and npm installed
- **VSCode** editor (version 1.96+)
- **GitHub Copilot** access (optional but recommended)

## Time Commitment

Each tutorial takes approximately **15-45 minutes** to complete, with the final capstone tutorial taking up to 60 minutes. You can work through them at your own pace.

## Tips for Success

1. **Work through tutorials in order** — Each builds on the previous
2. **Experiment** — Try modifying examples to deepen understanding
3. **Ask questions** — Use the [FINOS community discussions](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/discussions)
4. **Use AI assistance** — The CALM Copilot agent accelerates learning
