- [Enable AI Support](enable-ai-support) - Setup GitHub Copilot for CALM (calm init-ai -p copilot)
- [Define Initial Architecture](define-initial-architecture) - Core tutorial: AI identifies nodes from business context → architect refines → AI generates validated architecture JSON with nodes, relationships, and flows
- [Enhance Architecture Content](enhance-architecture-definition) - Placeholder (controls/governance)
- [Generate Documentation](generate-documentation) - Placeholder (template-based docs)
