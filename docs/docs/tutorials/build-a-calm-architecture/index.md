A hands-on tutorial demonstrating AI-assisted CALM architecture modeling for a hypothetical trading system, an event-driven microservices platform for financial services.

This tutorial will develop a CALM architecture by starting with a description of the business function, using it to create an initial architecture definition. The initial definition will then be updated to reflect technical details and non-functional requirements such as controls.

Tutorial Structure
- [Tool Setup](tool-setup) - Setup tools that will assist the architect in defining the CALM architecture (AI Assistant and CALM Tools)
- [Business Context](business-context) - Business requirements for the trading system (trading operations, accounts, positions, workflows)
- [Define Initial Architecture](define-initial-architecture) - Core tutorial: AI identifies nodes from business context → architect refines → AI generates validated architecture JSON with nodes, relationships, and flows
- [Refine Architecture Content](refine-architecture-definition) - Placeholder (controls/governance)
- [Generate Documentation](generate-documentation) - Placeholder (template-based docs)
