# CALM Tutorials

Welcome to the CALM learning path! These tutorials take you from zero CALM knowledge to modeling complete architectures.

:::tip Learning Path
This content follows the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). **Tutorials** (here) are learning-oriented, while **[How-To Guides](../how-to/)** are task-oriented references you can use after completing the basics.

## Start Here: Beginner Tutorials

### 🟢 Beginner Tutorials (1-7)

**No prior CALM knowledge required**

Learn the core building blocks of CALM architectures:
- Installing and configuring tools
- Creating nodes and relationships
- Understanding interfaces and metadata
- Building your first complete architecture

**Time commitment:** ~15-45 minutes per tutorial

## After the Basics

Once you've completed the beginner tutorials, you have two paths:

### 📘 How-To Guides

Task-oriented guides for specific goals. Use these as reference when you need to accomplish something specific.

| Category | Topics |
|----------|--------|
| [**Modeling**](../how-to/modeling/) | Controls, Flows, ADRs |
| [**Documentation**](../how-to/documentation/) | Docify, Widgets, Handlebars, AI Advisor |
| [**Operations**](../how-to/operations/) | Ops Advisor, Runbooks |
| [**Governance**](../how-to/governance/) | Patterns, Standards, Validation |

[Browse How-To Guides →](../how-to/)

### 🏆 Challenges

Apply your skills in realistic, role-based scenarios:

| Challenge | Role | Time |
|-----------|------|------|
| [Enterprise Architect](./challenges/enterprise-architect) | Chief Architect | 60-90 min |
| [Product Developer](./challenges/product-developer) | Senior Developer | 45-60 min |
| [Security SME](./challenges/security-sme) | Security Architect | 60-90 min |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Git** installed
- **Node.js** (20+) and npm installed
- **VSCode** editor (version 1.96+)
- **GitHub Copilot** access (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

1. **[Start with Tutorial 1](./beginner/01-setup)** — Set up your CALM workspace and tools
2. **Work through each tutorial** — They build on each other progressively
3. **Ask questions** — Join the [FINOS Architecture as Code community](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/discussions)

## Skills You'll Acquire

By completing all tutorials, you'll be able to:

✅ **Create** complete architecture documents from scratch  
✅ **Model** nodes, relationships, interfaces, and metadata  
✅ **Document** non-functional requirements with controls  
✅ **Capture** business processes with flows  
✅ **Record** decisions with ADRs  
✅ **Generate** documentation automatically  
✅ **Customize** output with templates  
✅ **Use AI** assistance for architecture work  
✅ **Create** organizational patterns and standards  
✅ **Enable** teams through proper governance  
✅ **Perform** systematic security reviews
