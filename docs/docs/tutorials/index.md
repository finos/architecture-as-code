## Start Here: Beginner Tutorials

### 🟢 Beginner Tutorials

**No prior CALM knowledge required**

Learn the core building blocks of CALM architectures:
- Installing and configuring tools
- Creating nodes and relationships
- Understanding interfaces and metadata
- Building your first complete architecture

**Time commitment:** ~15-45 minutes per tutorial

[Start with Beginner Tutorials →](./beginner/)

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Git** installed
- **Node.js** (20+) and npm installed
- **VSCode** editor (version 1.96+)
- **GitHub Copilot** access (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

1. **[Start with Setup & CLI](./beginner/01-setup)** — Set up your CALM workspace and tools
2. **Work through each tutorial** — They build on each other progressively
3. **Ask questions** — Join the [FINOS Architecture as Code community](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code/discussions)

## Skills You'll Acquire

By completing all tutorials, you'll be able to:

✅ **Create** complete architecture documents from scratch  
✅ **Model** nodes, relationships, interfaces, and metadata  
✅ **Use** the VSCode extension for visualization  
✅ **Build** realistic multi-service architectures

## Start Here: Practitioner

### 🛠️ Practitioner Tutorial

**Some CALM knowledge required, similar to what is covered in the Beginner tutorial.**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Git** installed
- **Node.js** (20+) and npm installed
- **VSCode** editor (version 1.96+)
- **CALM AI Assistant** Copilot, Claude or KIRO AI Assistant is enabled
- **calm cli** installed

## Skills You'll Acquire

By completing this tutorial, you'll see how to use the CALM AI Assistant to:

✅ **Create** complete architecture document from a business design  
✅ **Enhance** definition of nodes, relationships, interfaces, and metadata with organizational specific information  
✅ **Use** the VSCode extension for visualization   
✅ **Generate** views of the archcitecture  
✅ **Learn** best practices in working with CALM architectures
